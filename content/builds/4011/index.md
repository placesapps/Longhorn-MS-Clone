This buildâ€™s installer throws a debug assertion error. It's recommended to [start setup from another build's WinPE](/diskpart/). There used to be two different ISOs floating around the web. One had a corrupted Install.wim making the installation of the build impossible, the other installs fine. This build contains a Bar Settings Panel which seems to be an extension of the earlier seen [Avalon Display Panel](/avalon-display-panel/).
