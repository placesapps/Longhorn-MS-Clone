A system with this build was demoed at PDC 2003, showcasing the power of the Desktop Composition Engine. This system was accompanied by a system running build 4015 which was seen before at WinHEC 2003. Beside the two images [released by xBetas](https://web.archive.org/web/20031202161327/http://pdc.xbetas.com/content.php?page=aerodcedemo) a third image surfaced. This third image was initially misnamed as if it originated from build 4028.
