Despite this build appearing as a Windows XP Professional install functioning similarily to both builds [3790](/builds/3790) and [5000](/builds/5000), it comes with a modified version of both the Bliss wallpaper (adding a longhorn bull to it) and branding in order to indicate that it is a Longhorn build.

The out-of-box experience (OOBE) crashes as soon as the user completes the setup process.
