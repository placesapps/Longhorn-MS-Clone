This build was compiled on 2003-10-22 and leaked on 2004-03-01 by an unknown source together with some screenshots. It is very similar to 4051 and 4052 but had bugfixes for several networking and icon issues. It still has the Luna and Windows Classic themes with it but also the new Slate theme.
But also Build 4053 has bugs:

* Creating new user accounts via the GUI doesn't work. Use "control userpasswords2" for this.
* "Personal Folders" in Outlook shows the HTML source instead of the fully rendered page.
* "History" isn't working in Internet Explorer.
* "Frequently used items" in the Start Menu does reset every reboot.
* It seems to have some problems with driver signatures so every device installation needs to be confirmed.
