# The Experience Longhorn Project

The "Experience Longhorn" project was started by Melcher after taking over the longhorn.ms website from Thomas Hounsell, to create an authoritative resource for all things relating to Windows Longhorn.

The website went down earlier in 2019 but has now been revived once again by Thomas Hounsell. The content is being moved from a WordPress site to a Hugo static website, to enable easier contribution by third-parties. We actively encourage contributions via pull requests for new and updated content.

The canonical version of the website will sit at <https://longhorn.ms>.
